    <p>My first couple of days at HolidayCheck went really well, my first impression of the company was really great!</p>

<p>Upon arrival at HolidayCheck, I was greeted by current and former software engineer apprentices. After short introductions, I was shown to my desk. My equipment was all set, and I even recieved some gifts from the company! I was then introduced to everyone that Peri and I could find. There are many people and many names&hellip; but the &ldquo;National Specialties BBQ&rdquo; helped me familiarize myself with some of the employees.</p>

<p>I got the chance to spend a lot of time with my PPM, Alvaro, throughout the day. He answered all the questions I had (and I&rsquo;m sure many more to come), talked about his experience at HolidayCheck, and made me feel really comfortable with the whole onboarding process.</p>

<p>The rest of my time is spent going through a checklist of tasks from Wolfram, which consists of various things from exploring Logbook to organising a social event. I think I am making pretty good progress.
Some of my tasks for the week are create a blog, write a blog post every day, and start a self-organization method. The self-organization method will take some research and consideration (right now I am just using the Notes app to keep track of things I want to accomplish today)&hellip; so more on that later.</p>

<p>My plans for the rest of the day are to add my blog to HolidayCheck&rsquo;s apprenticeship page, complete the self assessment, and ENJOY THE WEATHER!</p>

<p>Everyone has been super friendly and open, which has made the transition of starting a new job in a new country extremely pleasant. I&rsquo;m excited for what is to come!</p>

<p>Bis Morgen:)</p>
