[{"categories":null,"contents":"Only three weeks of the business phase remain. Time is really flying. I guess this has a lot to do with being a part of a different team every week, as there are so many things to learn and people to meet. Last week I was with the Deep Learning team in Munich. One main thing they are working on is the chat feature. First of all, they want to increase the chat acceptance rate (which is the percentage of people who see the chat box that begin a conversation). Right now, there is a bug (which can only be fixed by the chat platform provider) where if a user clicks away the chat and navigates to another page, the chat feature will reappear. This can be skewing this acceptance rate because it is increasing the number of times a person sees the chat feature and does not choose to start a conversation. Kamal is also working on the chat bot. Right now they want to identify and predict the top 20 intents (e.g. how to apply the Gutschein, what is an airline\u0026rsquo;s baggage allowance, or hotel availability). So he is working on creating a model which predicts these top 20 intents with a high accuracy rate. The three intents which have automated responses are the following: Gutschein, baggage allowance, and recommendations. The other main thing the DL team is working on is offer recommendations. We talked about the current offer recommendations and other potential criteria. One potential criterion is flight quality. This could be something like a flight at 9 am versus a flight at 11 pm, a flight with 1 connection vs. 2 connections, a layover of 1.5 hours versus a layover of 8 hours, or perhaps a destination airport that is 30 minutes from the hotel versus an airport that is 3 hours from the hotel. All of these examples show varying travel quality, and Thomas brought up that spending more time at the destination also brings value to the Urlauber. This creates an upsell opportunity. Because it could show up on page 4 or 5, an offer with a better flight that is 50 euros more expensive is potentially an attractive offer that may never be seen. This is the reason we want to recommend an offer like this to the Urlaubers: it puts an offer with great value that is harder to find (or at least takes more time to find) on the very first page. This is something super powerful because we are making it easier for Urlaubers to find offers with higher value, with the potential of selling a pricier offer. It could be a win-win 😄 Nadja is a working student and she is working with the PR team to (hopefully) determine what is the most frequent review topic. She created a model that embeds the sentences of reviews, showing them in a multi-dimensional graph. Right now, the model does not show any obvious clusters (meaning no significantly more frequent topics or keywords in the reviews). However, her test data is the reviews of only one hotel, so maybe more clusters will appear when she feeds more reviews into her model (I have a feeling that my wording doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense to anyone with data science knowlege, but the hope is to make sense to those who do not 😅). I also got a change to speak with Isabelle and Ulrike from PR about what they do for HolidayCheck. Their team is small, and they handle all TV, print, and online content. They must keep up with media trends and find ways to integrate it with informatoin from HolidayCheck. One examples is doing a piece on fake reviews with things such as how to recognize them, what to do about them, and what HolidayCheck is doing to fight them. They also create content for less serious/more fun topics such as Oktoberfest-themed hotels. In contrast to brand marketing, the PR team is more focused on quality over quantity. This means that they care more about how long they can maintain a reader/viewer\u0026rsquo;s attention (which can translate to the quality of the information transfer) and less about the quantity of readers/viewers (but of course, having high quality and quantity is ideal). This was just a very brief overview of what they do, but it was definitely interesting to see how they are working towards creating and maintaining relationships with our audience. In the mean time, I got to work a little bit with Scala (but not as much as I would have liked). I wanted to play around with Options and created a simple Paczki (Polish filled donuts) project to do so. I created a Paczek (singular of Paczki) class and a Shop class, and I created a method which checks if a shop has a Paczek in stock with a certain filling. If the Paczek is in stock, the method returns the Paczek\u0026rsquo;s name (Some(paczek.name)). Otherwise, it would return nothing (Nothing). I showed the code to Lewis and he commented that it was organized in a very OO way, which just shows how used to OO design I am. We had a session today to talk about some modifications such as preferring \u0026lsquo;sealed type\u0026rsquo; extensions over class instances. I\u0026rsquo;ll work more on this during the week (I hope!). The time is coming where I have to think of masterpiece ideas. It came faster than I could anticipate, so it totally escaped me to ask around for pain points or suggestions. Brainstorming sessions are also on this week\u0026rsquo;s agenda. Until then - Happy Monday!

Does anyone know why it\u0026rsquo;s Programmer\u0026rsquo;s Day? Because it\u0026rsquo;s the 2^8th day of the year. Thank you Jacek for this important news 😂 This week I was in Poznań, spending most of my time in meetings, trying to pronounce Polish words, and drinking beer with Markus. Can\u0026rsquo;t complain about that! I sat with the AdShop team, who are under some pressure these days because of an approaching deadline. I caught them at a stressful time, but I was still able to learn a lot from people and see what they are working on. To give some background about what the AdShop team does, I should tell you that they are part of the b2b initiative. Marta is the PM of the AdShop team and she gave me in-depth explanations of each type of ad that HolidayCheck sells to hoteliers and business partners (for example hotel chains). They are as follows: 1) Premium: A hotelier can choose to enhance their hotel page on HolidayCheck with a link to their own website, a special offer, a special \u0026ldquo;profile picture\u0026rdquo;-esque photo (for example of the staff or the manager), and a small blurb about the hotel. 2) Ranking: A hotelier can choose to show up at the top of the hotel list page (after a user makes a search). This ad can be booked on the city, region, touristic region (e.g. Bayerische Alpen), and country level. 3) Competition: This is where a hotelier chooses to put a banner for their own hotel on the hotel page of a competition hotel(s). 4) Branding: The Branding Ads are displayed on the right-hand side of the hotel list. This entails a larger banner and larger photo of the hotel. This background information was complemented by the information I got from Alex. Alex (UX Designer, Writer \u0026amp; Guru (😉)) showed me the campaign manager that they are working on (a lot of which she designed). This is service where HolidayCheck sales managers can form advertisement offers for hoteliers. They can pick the type of ad(s) and see the prices for each available week. Once created, the form can be sent to the hotelier for review and/or confirmation, and then an actual order is created. Alex told me that the ads are often bought during an in-person meeting where the time frames and types of ads are chosen. This campaign manager will hopefully help this process. In the face-to-face meetings, a large excel spreadsheet is shown to the potential customers where they can see which weeks are available and which prices HolidayCheck is offering. As far as I understand the campaign manager is a tool for the sales managers during these meetings and potentially a tool to replace them. I thought one benefit that face-to-face transactions have (over booking online/via email) is that prices can be negotiated, possibly giving the hoteliers a better deal (which would make the hoteliers prefer the face-to-face transactions). I asked Alex about this and she said that the prices for each ad type + location + week combination are predetermined, so this does not cause any issues. They had user testing at the end of this week - so I\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully learn about the results soon 😄. I was able to \u0026ldquo;pair\u0026rdquo; with Jannick and Piotr, too, which was pretty cool. A little bit of JavaScript and a little (little) bit of Scala 😅. Jannick had to add a \u0026ldquo;back to offer details\u0026rdquo; button on the page visible when a customer/business partner is on the \u0026ldquo;checkout\u0026rdquo; page. Piotr was working on the method that removes sold out (unavailable) ad slots from the final offer. This is needed because when a sales manager makes an offer for a hotelier, the hotelier goes through the offer and can accept it. This process may take some time, so it is possible that an ad slot was bought by someone else by the time the hotelier accepts the offer and an actual order needs to be created. So Piotr wanted to make a check that all products (ad types) and variations (date and quantity) were still available, and delete those which are sold out from the order. I really appreciate how they both took time to not only show me what they were doing but also explain each step they wanted to take. Piotr especially made an effort to explain a lot of the Scala stuff (which wasn\u0026rsquo;t all completely foreign to me thanks to my Haskell knowlege), which was really interesting and cool! One thing is he compared having a Option object versus having an if else flow. The typical OO way of thinking is: \u0026ldquo;If some fetched object is null, then return null. Otherwise, access some member variable name, a String for example, and return it.\u0026rdquo; The way that Piotr showed me in Scala was thinking more along the lines of \u0026ldquo;No matter what this object is, we\u0026rsquo;ll return a Some String value.\u0026rdquo; It was much nicer to both code and read, because we don\u0026rsquo;t have to explicitly take care of each situation. We just wrap the value to say \u0026ldquo;maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get an object with a name, maybe we won\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; I will spend more time on this next week and actually blog some code to understand it a little better. Separate from the A-Team, Michał spent some time explaining the Wave Design System, which he, Luis, Jens and Bruce work on. I did get a brief rundown on the Design System from Luis one day on the tram to work. Previously, every element of HolidayCheck\u0026rsquo;s website was (re)developed by every team that needed to use it. For example, two teams could spend time on creating a \u0026ldquo;search\u0026rdquo; button, where on one page it could look slightly different (in color, size, font-size, border radius, etc.) than another. The goal of the Wave Design System is to define these elements (and things such as colors, font sizes and shadow sizes) for use and reuse. This, in turn, will save time for developers who would otherwise create these elements on their own. That\u0026rsquo;s cool 👍. I learned a lot this week, and I know Markus and I both felt extremely welcome. We got the chance to hang out with some employees outside of work and get to know the city better. I definitely recommend visiting if you have the chance! And if you ever consider booking a city tour - forget it! Jannick is a better solution (seriously, he knows so much about the city and it was such a pleasure to walk around with him). Next week I will be joining the ML team - which will also be quite interesting. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for the past week in Poznań and am excited for the week to come! Oh - and expect some Polish cookies on Monday! ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/post25/","tags":null,"title":"Post 25: POZ"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Last week, I was with the Brand Marketing team. First I met with Andreas who is senior social media manager. He and Julia make up the Social Media team, so they handle everything from responding to Facebook and Instagram messages/comments to creating social media content for social media accounts such as videos, campaigns, and Urlaub inspiration. One cool campaign is going on now where people send content where they can be an influencer for a day, and the winner receives a trip to Bali where they must create some content for HolidayCheck. I think this is super cool and powerful because it creates a strong relationship between HolidayCheck and the urlaubers. Also having Julia and Andi consistently in the content gives a friendly face to the Urlaubers, so people who follow our social media platforms see familiar faces that represent HolidayCheck. Another way they make a personal relationship with the Urlaubers is hosting Facebook and Instagram live trivia events. The prizes can be anywhere from unicorn floaties to vouchers that go towards package travel. The Facebook trivia winners were chosen randomly out of the users who commented a correct answer. The Instagram winners were chosen by randomly choosing someone who requested to be a contestant via videochat and asking them questions \u0026ldquo;face-to-face.\u0026rdquo; Each time someone posts their winnings or campaign submission, they serve as a sort of free advertisement. These are great, interactive ways to get HolidayCheck\u0026rsquo;s name out there. Next, Marlies showed me the offers she works on. The team posts about 11 offers per week. Marlies searches for a good offer in a chosen destination (which changes depending on the season). They make sure to post an offer that was found by searching within the best travel period so people don\u0026rsquo;t click an offer with an off-season price, only to choose their dates and have the prices skyrocket. Marlies also works on creating content for the Pinterest page, which shows destination highlights in hopes to inspire Urlaubers 😄. I also talked to Fabienne, who does a lot (to say the least). She collaborates with companies who want to either put a voucher on HolidayCheck or have a HolidayCheck voucher on their site (\u0026ldquo;spend 100 Euros and recieve a 50 Euro voucher for HolidayCheck\u0026rdquo;). She\u0026rsquo;s also in charge of the voucher online shop (where people can buy vouchers and send them as gifts), which I had never heard of! They are having a relaunch because the old shop was really old and not super usable or visible to the urlaubers (there was a tiny link on the footer of HolidayCheck\u0026rsquo;s site). So she worked a lot on redesigning the whole relaunch and hopes it becomes more popular amongst our Urlaubers. This is something really cool that I have not seen a lot of competitors do. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a great gift idea! Fabienne is filling in for someone who is on maternity leave, so she\u0026rsquo;ll only be at HolidayCheck for about 1.5 years (unless there is another position open for her) until the new mother comes back. She was saying how she has done these maternity leave covers before and she really likes it because she gets to learn a new company, a new team, a new job, and new people. I think that\u0026rsquo;s really cool and impressive. Her \u0026ldquo;onboarding\u0026rdquo; time must be shortened because there isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of time at the company! But this is also related to the fact that a change of scenery really boosts your learning/development (which Elena shared the other day at lunch relating to child development). Interesting! The power of leaving leaving your comfort zone\u0026hellip; This week I am at the Poznan office to be working with the A Team. I set my alarm for 3:45 this morning 😴. But a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep and a few more cups of coffee should fix me right up. Stay tuned! 😄 ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/post24/","tags":null,"title":"Post 24: My week with Brand Marketing"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I spent this week with the CRM team. I first spoke with Joana, who is a Senior CRM Manager, and she gave me a rundown on what the CRM teams. She showed me the Epi tool that the team uses to create emails and define their recipients. She also showed me the amount of fields related to each user that they have to consider - and let me tell you, it is overwhelming. She said they need all of these fields because the users expect emails to be very personal, understandably so. Next, I spoke with Jana. She is in charge of creating the emails that the urlaubers get pre, during, and post holiday. The pre holiday emails contain stuff like a packing list and what to know before going, the during holiday emails can show things to do and the weather in the destination, and the post-holiday emails ask the urlaubers to leave a review. Jana also talked about working with the ctmg team to create the email that is sent out when people flying from Düsseldorf choose access to the airport lounge instead of the 100 euro voucher. Something weird happened to Jana this week where she was trying to format the deadline date in the email for the 100 euro voucher redemption. She wanted to change the field \u0026ldquo;frist\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;deadline\u0026rdquo; in German - to the format of dd.MM.yyy, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working for her! She typed in everything correctly, using the same format as another date formatter that worked just fine. She ended up calling someone and it turns out they translated the field \u0026ldquo;frist\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;deadline.\u0026rdquo; Apparently they must not use German words. I think that\u0026rsquo;s so silly that she encountered this problem without even knowing that the fieldnames were changed. But whoever she called was quite accessible as Jana was able to get it resolved quickly 😄 Jana also told me that the target group calculation is very complex and there are about 1800 target groups. These groups are used to determine who gets what content in the emails. For example if someone already booked a rental car, they will not get email content on how to get to the hotel from the airport. Nor will they get content that suggests renting a car. Another example is that people will get inspirational content about their booked destination. Lena is in charge of the newsletters. The newletter containing holiday offers is sent out every week. The inspirational newsletter (which contains content from Away Magazine highlighting certain destinations) is sent out every other week. I got to see how the Epi tool gives data on how many people opened an email and how many people click on each element. Lena also shared that the team uses Google analytics to see how many people actually booked as a result of clicking on something in the newsletter. But the actual impact of these newsletters is hard to determine because this data acquired by Google is only in the case that someone goes directly from clicking the email to completing a booking, without ever leaving the browser. It is often times the case that people see inspirational content in the newsletter, click the images to learn more, browse around, close their windows for whatever reason (work, dinner, bedtime, etc.) and book through HolidayCheck sometime later. And finally, I met with Jochen, whom I was supposed to meet with last week. It kind of seems like we talked about a million things during this meeting, but it was all interesting! I learned about what he does on a \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; day and the ideal process of defining, creating, and testing a feature. He also shared that when a user quickly moves the mouse to the top of a page, it typically means they want to exit, and this can trigger something to pop up that asks for feedback. That\u0026rsquo;s creepy! But cool!! I also learned some funny things such as: People leave reviews for Check24 on HolidayCheck, people click \u0026ldquo;feedback\u0026rdquo;, then \u0026ldquo;Ich möchte etwas über HolidayCheck sagen,\u0026rdquo; then leave a review for a hotel they stayed at 😄, and Mallorca is basically an extension of Germany. This week during our Katas, we worked a lot on creating test case descriptions that are actually descriptive. This was triggered by Jacek\u0026rsquo;s comments on one of our code snippets that was a parser of reverse Polish notation. He did not know what it was, and encouraged us to make test descriptions that make the reader understand exactly what the code is doing. Markus, Ewa, and I worked on this. On Friday (today), Masha joined the reverse Polish notation kata for the first time, so we were able to get her feedback on how descriptive our tests were. There is still room for improvement, but she had a pretty good understanding of reverse polish notation - so that\u0026rsquo;s a small success! I learned a lot this week sitting with the CRM team, and I received some good holiday destination suggestions 😌. I also think it was good for me to be surrounded by so much German (even though I practically did not understand any of it) because I\u0026rsquo;m starting a German course next week. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful Friday, and this previously sick human is finally healthy enough for a beer! Cheers to that 🍻 ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/post23/","tags":null,"title":"Post 23: My week with CRM"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello - it\u0026rsquo;s been a minute hasn\u0026rsquo;t it!? The current status of the Chrome extension is \u0026ldquo;Under Review.\u0026rdquo; I gave my extension permission to access all urls (because any url could be entered to the Google Sheets document), and this leads to a longer review time. I don\u0026rsquo;t automatically see a way around this because asking someone to add the url permission to the code every time they want to add a site to the rotation is not ideal. Not only is this inconvenient, but it would also make things a lot slower because the extension would have to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store for review every time someone adds a url\u0026hellip; 😅 I also have been working on the company calendar webapp. I spent a lot of time implementing user authentication. I then wanted to access the Microsoft shared calendar via the Calendar API. However, it turns out that this API only works with online accounts and not on-premise accounts. I thought a solution to this would be to make the company calendar email account an online account - but we are checking if this is plausible. I got to shadow Anna, who\u0026rsquo;s a UX Designer, in Munich. I got advice to ask as many questions as I could - and I did just that. I sat in on her meetings, listened carefully, and asked her questions after the meetings (so as to not take the time of too many people). One thing I found really interesting is how a certain logo or a certain phrasing impacts users\u0026rsquo; actions. It made sense to me that these changes could influence the time it takes a user to click a certain thing, but I never thought that it would significantly cause or deter someone from executing an action. Related to this, Anna, Sebastian, and Max were talking about the exit rate of the Review page. The exit rate is the rate of users who exit the HolidayCheck website from the Review page. They wanted to compare the exit rate of this page when reached via 2 different logos. How many people come to this page by clicking the old button (old logo and old wording) and exit HolidayCheck (as in, they were surprised by or not interested in what they saw) versus those who come to this page by clicking the new button (new logo and new wording)? I think that\u0026rsquo;s really interesting and quite powerful\u0026hellip; What can we do to better inform the user where they are going? What can we do to avoid misleading a user? These are all things that I have experienced from the user side, so it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to think how my actions can change based on these details. I also learned about what Anja does. She\u0026rsquo;s a UX Writer, which is profession I had never heard of before coming to HolidayCheck. It\u0026rsquo;s such an important job because it entails creating the dialogue between the website and the user. In a way, this dialogue forms HolidayCheck\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality.\u0026rdquo; Do we want to be more formal with our urlaubers - or more personal? These things are discussed every day, and sometimes many days\u0026rsquo; worth of work results in just a few sentences. I know I said this before, but I find it really interesting to see the work that goes into creating these interfaces and learning about how slight changes can really affect a user\u0026rsquo;s decisions.\nAfter this, I was able to talk to Christian, a Visual Designer. I learned a lot about the structure of his work - from the creative side of using Figma to collaboratively (in a Google Docs manner) create designs, to actually rolling out a new design. Between these two ends, a lot of testing takes place to measure how one design affects the users\u0026rsquo; actions versus another. Christian shared that testing many things may take years to reach statistical significance. And since he has been at HolidayCheck for about 4.5 years, Christian was also able to share that design decisions were made without any data on how users react, prior to the use of AB tests. Here\u0026rsquo;s a short dialogue that took place after I learned this: Me (curious): What happened if you chose a feature that resulted in a worse conversion rate?\nHim: It never happened ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Me (almost a software engineer, who must test everything): 🤯 I also got to watch 2 recordings of the user tests which were super interesting (only one was entirely in English). It was quite cool to see how the users react to specific features, especially those who use certain features differently than I do. For example, I would always choose the specific dates of travel, never the duration. It was even cooler to see how Anna and Susi carried out the tests. They start out with some background information about the tester: what type of holidays they usually go on, with whom they usually travel, how they pick their destinations, where they usually book their holidays, etc. Then there is a disclaimer that they will just be using a prototype so not all features are working - and the product is what is being tested, not the user. I think it\u0026rsquo;s easy to make it feel like an interview/interrogation, but Susi and Anna did a nice job of keeping the users comfortable and the environment casual - of course while extracting as much information as they can from the users. It would have been interesting to watch an older person\u0026rsquo;s interview (there was one but unfortunately it was in German) because I want to know what features are used more/less among those people. For example one younger user shared that he did not like how he couldn\u0026rsquo;t choose 3 people and 2 rooms. The prototype gave the option to call HolidayCheck, but he said he was hesistant because he rarely has a good experience with calling and talking to a representative. The other user said she would call - although she would expect to be able to choose 2 rooms. In my case, I would be hesitant to call - especially in the case that I am just browsing the hotel list and not yet ready to book. Throughout the week, I learned a lot from the UI/UX \u0026ldquo;team.\u0026rdquo; I learned that the jobs accross the UI/UX area rely very heavily on data, which is something that I did not consider prior to this week. I got more insight on what the developement teams are working on and their relationship with the designers, researchers, and writers. We also played kicker and Georg and I were undefeated!!!!! (until we weren\u0026rsquo;t). I quickly re-learned that I am not so good at kicker 😄. Unfortunately I caught a cold and was OOTO on Thursday and Friday, so some meetings are being postponed until next week. But it was a great week spent with these people - and a very nice change of pace. Next week I will be with the marketing team. Until then! 👋 ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/post22/","tags":null,"title":"Post 22: My week with UI/UX"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The last time you heard from me was when I was struggling with Javscript promises. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I said about the problem in the previous post: \u0026ldquo;In the sheet of URLs, a duration can also be included in an entry. This represents, in milliseconds, how long a url should be displayed. I want to create a for loop (I think) that has a promise in it (I think) so that the url does not change until the previous url has been shown for the desired amount of time. I tried a solution that used recursion, but since I want to infinitely rotate the urls (until the browser window is closed), this creates stacks on stacks on stacks.\u0026rdquo; I have learned 2 grand things since then: \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;1. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to use promises here because there is nothing asynchronous happening, so setTimeout is our better friend here\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;2. Using setTimeout in a recursive function is good! There will only be one frame for the function on the stack at one time (https://develoger.com/settimeout-vs-setinterval-cff85142555b)\nSo with these 2 things in mind, I got what I needed. I created a function setDurations where for a each tab, I call setTimeout with the specific tab\u0026rsquo;s duration. After this duration has passed, the (recursive) callback function to switch to the next tab is called. Here is my code: function setDurations (urlSettings, openTabs, tabIdx, time) { setTimeout(function() { chrome.tabs.update(openTabs[tabIdx].id, {active: true}); const nextTabIdx = (tabIdx + 1) % openTabs.length; setDurations(urlSettings, openTabs, nextTabIdx, getDuration(urlSettings, openTabs[tabIdx].url)); }, time); }  And it works like a charm 😄 My next endeavor was to handle faulty urls in the google sheets document. My goal was to create a fetch request to the given url, and then add that url to my set if (and only if) the status returned is \u0026ldquo;ok.\u0026rdquo; When playing around with recursive promises again, I hoped that I could make this better. Because we want to move on to check the next url no matter the result of current fetch, a recursive call is needed in both the .then() and the .catch() blocks, which is not ideal. I could not get my recursive solution to work originally (more about this later), but here\u0026rsquo;s what I came up with after some research (note that the \u0026ldquo;async\u0026rdquo; before the function definition makes it so the function returns a promise, with the returned value being the \u0026ldquo;resolved\u0026rdquo; value of the promise): function recursiveCheckUrls(entries, settings, index) { if (index === entries.length) return settings; let urlString = entries[index][\u0026lsquo;gsx$url\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; let duration = entries[index][\u0026lsquo;gsx$duration\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; fetch(urlString) .then(() =\u0026gt; { settings[urlString] = duration; recursiveCheckUrls(entries, settings, index + 1); }) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; { console.log(urlString + \u0026ldquo;: \u0026ldquo; + err); recursiveCheckUrls(entries, settings, index + 1); }); }  While reading about other approaches, I came across the \u0026ldquo;async/await\u0026rdquo; method, which allowed for a non-recursive method (and also allowed me to understand why my recursive approach was not working!!): async function checkUrls(entries, settings, index) { for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt;= entries.length; ++i) { if (i === entries.length) return settings; let urlString = entries[i][\u0026lsquo;gsx$url\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; let duration = entries[i][\u0026lsquo;gsx$duration\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; await fetch(urlString) .then(() =\u0026gt; { settings[urlString] = duration; }) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; { console.log(urlString + \u0026ldquo;: \u0026ldquo; + err); }); } }  So here, I wait for the current url to be fetched (and either added to the map of urls or not), and then move on to the next. Later, I showed my code to Ewa because she has been working a lot with promises and async/await. She told me that usually awaits are used to get rid of multiple .then() blocks. She sent me a really nice link, too.\nOne thing this article talks about is nicer error handling, where all errors (synchronous and asyncronous) can be handled by one try/catch block when we use await. In my case, I want to stay in the function and continue as normal if an error is thrown, so I put a catch block in the for loop: async function checkUrls(entries, settings, index) { for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt;= entries.length; ++i) { if (i === entries.length) return settings; let urlString = entries[i][\u0026lsquo;gsx$url\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; let duration = entries[i][\u0026lsquo;gsx$duration\u0026rsquo;][\u0026lsquo;$t\u0026rsquo;]; try { let response = await fetch(urlString); if (response.ok) { settings[urlString] = duration; } } catch (err) { console.log(urlString + \u0026ldquo;: \u0026ldquo; + err); } } }  This code is much nicer for me to read, though I\u0026rsquo;m still searching for some improvements\u0026hellip; (if you have any suggestions, please reach out 😄) That was a lot of code, but it was worth writing down here. Besides all of this refactoring, today I also read about testing chrome extensions. I set up Selenium to automatically open Chrome with the extension already installed. This took me much longer than anticipated. But now it works - and tomorrow I will actually start testing. My plan is to create a dummy set of urls, and then loop through the html of the open tabs to make sure that valid urls were opened, and those that are invalid were not. Until then, friends. \n","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/post21/","tags":null,"title":"Post 21: Promises vs. Async/await"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello to all 😄 The past few days have been spent working on a chrome extension. The purpose of this chrome extension is to be able to rotate between a set of URLs on the heartbeat monitors to give employees more insight on what\u0026rsquo;s happening at HolidayCheck. Now, you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking an extension that rotates between tabs already exists, and you\u0026rsquo;d be correct. But we want this extension to get some links from somewhere, open them up automatically, and then rotate between those tabs. Manually opening tabs every day for every monitor would be painful. So, up until yesterday, my extension opened specific urls (found in the code itself) in their own tab, and rotated between the tabs. Yesterday I attempted to put these links in an excel file in my One Drive, give my extension access to this file, and then use the Microsoft Graph API to fetch the data inside this file. Sadly, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. My app cannot be authorized to access any files unless it is logged in as someone, which would also be painful to do on all of the monitors. So today I migrated this url file to good old Google Sheets. You can actually easily turn this Google Sheets document into an endpoint that serves you JSON. It\u0026rsquo;s quite cool. Check it out here. But of course things never pan out that easy. Because I have little experience with asynchronous things (for lack of a better term), I was accessing a dictionary of urls that didn\u0026rsquo;t have what I needed because the GET request to my Google Sheets didn\u0026rsquo;t finish yet. Bad, bad, bad. I should\u0026rsquo;ve known better. I was just going crazy because I initialized my dictionary with dummy values, printed it out, and then printed the keys. When I extended the dictionary in the console, the urls were indeed there, but they were not being printed out in the place where I printed the keys. So it was printing these things when the urls weren\u0026rsquo;t added yet, then adding the urls by the time I got there to extend the dictionary object 🥵 With Sebastian\u0026rsquo;s help with promises, I got the functionality I wanted (and much, much cleaner code). But of course things never pan out that easy\u0026hellip; In the sheet of URLs, a duration can also be included in an entry. This represents, in milliseconds, how long a url should be displayed. I want to create a for loop (I think) that has a promise in it (I think) so that the url does not change until the previous url has been shown for the desired amount of time. I tried a solution that used recursion, but since I want to infinitely rotate the urls (until the browser window is closed), this creates stacks on stacks on stacks. Tomorrow, I will read about promises and hopefully solve this problem.

Sandro talks about how software crafters should (and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) interview cadidates. He writes that having phone interviews, writing code on paper or a white board, and only testing algorithmic knowlege or easily google-able problems (as opposed to giving a problem closely related to the actual work done during the job) are recipes for disaster. Or, rather, not recipes for success. This chapter really surprised me because Sandro is talking down upon many interviewing techniques that I had experienced over, and over again while I was interviewing for my first full-time job just several months ago. I thought these methods were good and normal. I thought interviewing was something that will always feel like an uncomfortable and unnatural interrogation. I had a few great interviews where the interviewer was kind, personable, and did not make me feel like every word I spoke had the potential to kill me*. I got lucky with those interviews because they were the exceptions, I thought. But Sandro emphasizes that we should treat the candidate like a peer in order to have the highest potential to see what it is like to actually work with this person. And he reminds the reader that the candidate is also interviewing the company to see if he/she would enjoy working there. I remember one technical interview (that surprisingly did not blatantly test an algorithm) where the question was incorrect. The interviewer wanted me to do something with converting US Dollars to Euros (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the exact problem), and the conversion rate was reversed (stating that in order to convert US Dollars to Euros, one must multiply by, for example, 1.2 instead of divide). When I brought up the mistake to the interviewer, I was really shocked to see his reaction. He was very taken aback and said \u0026ldquo;oh, uh\u0026hellip; yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re right. Let\u0026rsquo;s carry on with the correct way.\u0026rdquo; But as I kept working through the problem, the interviewer acted very distant and did not seem to be paying full attention. After some time had passed, he finally said, \u0026ldquo;honestly I have no idea if you\u0026rsquo;re going in the right direction because my solution was based around multiplying the conversion rate instead of dividing. Can you start over and solve the problem by multiplying?\u0026rdquo;. Of course I did what he asked and, as a result, did not get as far in solving the problem as I would have liked. Leaving this interview, I was definitely annoyed by the interviewer. The problem for me is not about who was right and who was wrong. Nor was it about him asking me to solve the problem twice. The problem is that he was not able to accept a solution that was different from his own. He had me sovle the problem again just so my solution was more in-line with his. Was he testing to see if my solution would be the exact same as his? Would any solution different to his own result in a \u0026ldquo;docking\u0026rdquo; of points? Who knows? In this situation, I would retrospectively say that this interviewer did not move on to the next round of my interviews. Of course I cannot judge a company based on one employee, but it still left a sour taste in my mouth. On another note, today I worked on docker, dust, and dmc (oh my!) and I finally deployed my Hello World app! Hooray!!!! I was having a problem where my dmc deploy command would just cause the possible dmc commands to be printed to the terminal, so I knew I was doing something wrong, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what. I seeked others for help which led me closer to my goal, no doubt. But I was still stuck and I had no idea why! I finally sent out an S.O.S. to Peri, and he really did save my shi(p/t). Some problems were as follows: I was using the wrong dmc (😅), there was a typo in my command (silly mistake, but hard for me to catch because the command was so long - I also learned from Peri that it can be reduced by omitting things already included in the deploymate.json file), I had an incorrect health check path (\u0026ldquo;/health\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;/_health\u0026rdquo;), and there was a misallocation of memory (as npm start takes up a lot of memory. This is something that needs to be changed, but more on this tomorrow). Now I will go to the grocery store and continue reading about microservices later tonight.

Kay had brought up that we should start our katas by discussing a goal, which is something that we overlooked before. Our current code supports the \u0026ldquo;mov\u0026rdquo; (move an integer value into some register), \u0026ldquo;dec\u0026rdquo; (decrement the value contained in some register), \u0026ldquo;inc\u0026rdquo; (increment the value in some register), and \u0026ldquo;jnz\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;jump not zero\u0026rdquo;: jump some number of instructions forward or backward as long as some register does not contain 0) commands. Today, we refactored our code. We created a state object which holds the registers, program counter (pc), error status, and the program (a list of commands). This is much more readable, and it is good design to wrap all of these attributes in one object. We then modified our functions to be contained in a dictionary, where the key is the command and the value is the function that handles this command. It looks like this: const Interpreters = {\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026ldquo;mov\u0026rdquo;: movCommand,\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026ldquo;inc\u0026rdquo;: incCommand,\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026ldquo;dec\u0026rdquo;: decCommand,\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026ldquo;jnz\u0026rdquo;: jnzCommand\n}  That way, an instruction can be called like so:\nconst command = commands[state.pc];\nconst [instruction, \u0026hellip;args] = command.split(\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;);\nInterpreters[instruction](state, args);  Right now, we do not have a class object to wrap the state object and these methods into one thing. We discussed this, but it was brought up that because we only have one state instance, it might not be necessary to create this class object. Maybe this is still up for debate, because passing the state object with each call of these methods does not seem necessary either. It does feel more beneficial when we do the katas this way, because I am learning about design and programming with a goal other than to just solve the kata (this is not to say that we ignored good coding practices, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t specifically a goal that we discussed every day). Also, because this kata has many parts (where more instructions are added), it was a good idea to do the refactoring (kind of) in the beginning to make our lives easier later 😄 I also worked on Docker today. I worked on the tutorial found here. I am just not sure how much of the tutorial is applicable to the deployment process at HolidayCheck because of dust and kubernetes. Peri gave me and Markus the Dust platform training, and I surprisingly did not have many questions during the training. But, more and more questions arose as I was completing this docker tutorial and as I began the process of deploying the Hello World app (as the first step in the Heartbeat monitor journey). More on this tomorrow :) I ended my day with a meeting with Álvaro (oh, and writing this blog post) concerning the whole compensation process. I learned a lot about his team\u0026rsquo;s tenets, how/when/why salaries increase at HolidayCheck, and the north of Spain 🌄. See you tomorrow 👋 P.S.

My current endeavors include foldr and foldl, and believe me: the going got tough. One thing that confused me is the following: Prelude\u0026gt; foldr const 0 ([1..3] ++ undefined)\n\u0026gt;1\nThis works!\n(Note that simply concatenating undefined to a list throws an error, because the list - in its entirety - is evaluated, and the (++) function requires two list arguments.)\n(Also note that const takes two arguments and returns the first argument.)\n(Also also note that foldr works like so: foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs))\nLet\u0026rsquo;s name our list ([1..3] ++ undefined) lst. Here is what happens first: foldr const 0 lst = const (head lst) (foldr const 0 (tail lst)) Since the const function just ignores the second argument, 1 is returned. But, when I wrote this out on paper, I was getting so confused:\n(const 1 (const 2 (const 3 (const undefined 0))))\nWhy doesnt \u0026lsquo;const undefined 0\u0026rsquo; throw an error? Because it is never evaluated as the outer most parentheses are evaluated first, and const just ignores the second argument (bold for emphasis). As for foldl:\nPrelude\u0026gt; foldl const 0 ([1..3] ++ undefined)\n\u0026gt;*** Exception: Prelude.undefined\n\u0026gt;CallStack (from HasCallStack):\n\u0026gt;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:78:14 in base:GHC.Err\n\u0026gt;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;undefined, called at :119:26 in interactive:Ghci20\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t work!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it is written out on paper: ((((1 `const` 0) `const` 2) `const` 3) `cons` undefined) Here, the outermost parentheses contain undefined, and therefore an error is thrown. (I put the `` around const to make it an infix operator for visual purposes. Otherwise, the expansion looks similar to that of foldr). This really confused me. I was thinking: How does foldr know where the end of the list is without having to evaluate the undefined part and foldl doesn\u0026rsquo;t? How does foldr know when to stop looking for more elements in the list and foldl doesn\u0026rsquo;t? But after some help from Lewis, Frank, Francesco, and Daniel (and God (kidding)), it all makes sense. It was funny to see the confusion this question caused, but it thankfully came to a resolution 😄 Tomorrow I will (start my day at the Ausländerbehörde at 7:30*, then) implement some functions (which I already completed with recursion) using folds such as myOr (a function that applies logical or to a list of booleans), myAny (a function that returns whether or not some value in a list meets a certain condition), and squish (which flattens a list of lists into one list). It will be pretty tough to get out of the recursive mindset and implement these functions with folds, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll come out alive 😅 I will also do some research on the testing pyramid and Docker (whether that be using online or human sources). Signing off! 👋 * When I was at the Ausländerbehörde the other day, I ended up waiting in the wrong line for 1.5 hours, only to get to the correct place for Blue Card applications and be told that there were no more spots for the day.

I\u0026rsquo;ve completed the Haskell chapters on recursion and lists, and I feel pretty accomplished! I\u0026rsquo;m currently learning about folding lists, which is not as pleasant. Here\u0026rsquo;s an exercise from the book: The following fold has an error. Fix it and then test it in your REPL. foldr const \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; [1..5]\nIf we check the type of const (a function that takes two arguments and returns the first), we get: const :: a -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; a Now, let\u0026rsquo;s check the type of foldr: foldr :: Foldable t =\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; t a -\u0026gt; b Do you see the problem? The type of const does not align with the type required by foldr. The solution is fairly simple: apply flip to const: foldr (flip const) \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; [1..5]\nThe type of (flip const) is: (flip const) :: b -\u0026gt; c -\u0026gt; c This is a solution that took me quite some time to figure out. To no avail, I was filling my notebook with scribbles and parentheses. The solution :t was just waiting for my in my REPL 😄 Another thing that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work: foldl (:) [] [1..3] (The (:) is the cons function that prepends a head to a list) I really had no idea why this didn\u0026rsquo;t work as I wrote it out. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I wrote: (([] : 1) : 2) : 3 ([1] : 2) : 3 ([2, 1]) : 3 [3, 2, 1] But, no! The REPL throws an error because the type of the (:) function is (:) :: a -\u0026gt; [a] -\u0026gt; [a]. The first argument must be some object of type a, and the second must be a list that contains objects of type a, and the function returns a list that contains objects of type a. The arguments cannot be switched. The topic of folding is very confusing for me, but checking the types of the functions in these exercises help me see the errors and how to fix them. I\u0026rsquo;ll take more time tomorrow to work through the chapter. I also met with Peri today to discuss my progress and the plan for the coming month. One suggestion he made is to rehearse my Haskell learnings through blog posts or lightning talks, hence the small exercise example above. Once I understand foldr and foldl better, I plan to write a more in-depth blog post on the topic. This is just a way to deepen my understanding of the topic. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t treat it like a university course and mechanically work through the book and exercises just to get it done. I should treat it as a topic that I want to learn and, more importantly, teach others about (of course this is not to say that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been enjoying Haskell - because I do! Suprisingly!) Writing blog posts about any of the things I am learning is a way to articulate my thoughts, and I think this is especially helpful for something like functional programming, which confused and angered me in a previous life 🍃 After this, I met with Ugurcan to talk about the Heartbeat project and my goals. The first goal he suggested is to create a simple \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; application and deploy it, just to learn about docker and the dust platform. This was a great suggestion, because it is something that I need to understand before I can move on with this project. I made many new plans today. I have also added 3 trainings/workshops to my TODO list thanks to Peri\u0026rsquo;s and Ugurcan\u0026rsquo;s suggestions. So much to do! So much to see! So much to learn! 🤓 ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/day16/","tags":null,"title":"Blog 16: New plans"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Today was filled with meetings. I had the daily, the \u0026ldquo;Blindspot\u0026rdquo; meeting with Alvaro and his whole group of people of which he\u0026rsquo;s the PPM (not sure what to call this group), a meeting with Ugurcan concerning the setup of the Heartbeat project on my machine, a meeting with Wolfram, and my one-on-one with Alvaro. As a result, my Haskell book has collected (virtual) dust. I spent a lot of my non-meeting time with the Elevator Saga again. I was having a problem where I was creating an event listener for each floor object (for the event where a person presses the up button or down button) in a for-loop. Each of these event listeners would then add the current floor to a set of floors called upButtonFloors and downButtonFloors, respectively. The problem with the following code is that, if there are 5 floors, the value of floorNum that was always being added to the sets is 5. for (floorNum = 0; floorNum \u0026lt; floors.length; floorNum++) {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;floors[floorNum].on(\u0026ldquo;up_button_pressed\u0026rdquo;, function() {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;upButtonFloors.add(floorNum);\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;}); \n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;floors[floorNum].on(\u0026ldquo;down_button_pressed\u0026rdquo;, function() {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;downButtonFloors.add(floorNum); \n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;});\n}\nThis question turned my meeting with Wolfram into a JavaScript Closure meeting (instead of a meeting about ways to have the Heartbeat monitors rotate between different URLs). Wolfram taught me about the call stack and what happens with asynchronous instructions. We worked through a more general example in TDD bin that asynchronously added values to an array. We went over what works (and why) and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t (and why). It was a lot to digest, but going through this example made everything a lot clearer. In the end, we learned that simply adding a \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rdquo; will reduce the scope of floorNum to just the body of the for loop, so when an event happens, the handler calls a function with the intended value. Though I know this is not a complete answer to \u0026ldquo;why this works.\u0026rdquo; If I were a more seasoned JavaScript programmer, I would have added the let in the first place and therefore would not have run into this problem. But I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did because it led me to ask Wolfram, which led to an in depth explanation of what is happening under the hood and how to fix it. If I had added the let, I would have no real understanding of the call stack, what happens when we call setTimeout(), and how asynchronous instructions are handled in JavaScript (which is single threaded, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure most of you know). Regarding the Heartbeat monitors, there are quite a few chrome extensions that rotate between different URLs (one has the name \u0026ldquo;Rotisserie,\u0026rdquo; which kind of displeases me because it makes me think of chicken) which, as of now, seems like the route I will take. The cool thing about this is that anyone who wants to add a feature may create their own application and add the link to the list of URLs on rotate. Alvaro was saying how this would be good for future apprentices/interns to contribute to as well. It would be an interesting why to learn how to create a web application while also adding value to the company! So, my day flew by and it has come to an end.

Today, Wolfram joined the kata, but neither Masha nor Kay could join and Markus had to leave early. Our current kata does not involve TDD (😱). The problem is called \u0026ldquo;Elevator Saga.\u0026rdquo; Each level provides a task to move x amount of people in some amount of time, using only a certain number of elevators. The simulator is the main source of testing, which provides random input to test your solution. In the katas that I joined, we only made it to level 5. Our next step was to refactor to make it more readable and pass the simulation more often (😅). Wolfram was grilling me with all these questions: \u0026ldquo;What is your goal?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How do you know when you have improved?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What is your approach?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What do you want to learn from this problem?\u0026rdquo;. I never thought about neither these questions nor their answers. My approach was just to pass each level. So after explaining the half-baked solution to him, Wolfram suggested many ways to make the code more readable. He also taught me that creating an event listener inside of an event listener results in only creating the inner event listener when the outer even is triggered (and, it will do this every time). This is bad. My solution to this aspect was to create an event listener once for each floor object. There are many other ways in which the code needs to be improved. Right now when it is passing a floor on which people are waiting, the elevator does not pick them up. More on this tomorrow. I also worked on Haskell today which was focused on recursion. I was getting some pretty headache-y errors in the REPL when trying to create a function that took an integer n and return a list that contains each digit, in order, of n.

Here is something I came accross in the Haskell book yesterday, regarding function composition: \u0026ldquo;(.) :: [1](b -\u0026gt; c) -\u0026gt; [2](a -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; [3](a -\u0026gt; c) In English:\n1. given a function b to c\n2. given a function a to b\n3. return a function a to c The result of (a -\u0026gt; b) is the argument of (b -\u0026gt; c) so this is how we get from an a argument to a c result. We’ve stitched the result of one function into being the argument of another.\u0026rdquo; This is another example of initially being very confused as a result of overthinking. I think point 3 is what really tripped me up. The wording of \u0026ldquo;returning a function\u0026rdquo; is weird to me, but the book does a nice job of explaining what exaclty happens. And for that, I am very grateful 😄. I also spoke with Wolfram and Markus (Scheuermann, not Heilig) about potential additions to Ugurcan\u0026rsquo;s Heartbeat project. We discussed making the information more personal, with hopes to spark conversation. Markus said something like \u0026ldquo;information that encourages action.\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s a good mindset to have going forward with this project. Wolfram and I briefly discussed our first step: Come up with a way to have multiple urls on rotation, where one can easily add/remove urls displaying different information. Exciting! Today I did more Haskell and read some of the Software Crafter book. I also spent some time refreshing my memory on the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges (this urge was sparked when I saw the Haskell book quote him at the beginning of the recursion chapter), and I stumbled accross some information that he was incredibly racist and said awful things about black people. That was a disappointing tangent to which, oddly enough, the Haskell book led me. But back to the main path of focus: Recursion, hooray! Here\u0026rsquo;s one of the first examples they give, where a number n is incremented times times: incTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) =\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; a\nincTimes 0 n = n\nincTimes times n = 1 + (incTimes (times - 1) n) Then the function is called like so:\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 10 0\n10\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 5 0\n5\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 5 5\n10 The only unintuitive thing, for me, is seeing incTimes 0 n = n. It\u0026rsquo;s strange to see how this is how base cases (and, similarly, conditionals) are defined. It\u0026rsquo;s just weird not to see an if in there. Otherwise, things are smooth sailing with Haskell. Things are also smooth sailing regarding my Bürgerbüro visits\u0026hellip; I finally got my tax ID!!!! The next step is the Ausländerbehörde, which is even more complicated and even more inaccessible 😅.

Time is flying (I just realized that I have probably said this at the beginning of every week of my (adultish) life). Today, I worked through more of the Haskell Programming book. I went over pattern matching, case examples, and higher order functions. Though the book does a good job explaining the why\u0026rsquo;s and how\u0026rsquo;s, functional programming still feels quite unintuitive to me. One thing that is hard for me to conceptualize (and I tend to overthink) is function types. An example given in the book is: returnAfterApply :: (a -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; c -\u0026gt; b returnAfterApply f a c = f a At first, only looking at the function type, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking: Ok, returnAfterApply takes a function and returns a function that takes a function and returns something of type b??? 😅 But then I look at the function definitions and I think: Ohhhh, so it takes three parameters: 1. a function f that takes some thing of type a and returns something of type b, 2. something of type a, and 3. something of type c. Then it applies the function f to a and returns whatever is returned by f (something of type b). Then all is good again in my brain. But still, I\u0026rsquo;m prepared for more unintuition. Other things I did today include reading the Software Crafter book, doing part of a bash tutorial (which I really enjoy, thanks Masha!), and cloning the repo for Ugurcan\u0026rsquo;s heartbeat project. I plan to make more progress on all of these things tomorrow as well. I feel like I have plenty to do, without feeling spread too thin. It\u0026rsquo;s a good place to be 😎.

The task is to transport 20 people in 60 seconds, going to the floor to pick them up and dropping them off on their desired floor. The problem and simulator can be found here. We passed the level where the building was 3 stories high, but could not figure out an algorithm quick enough for a building with 4 stories. To be continued\u0026hellip; hopefully. The rest of my day was spent with Haskell, which somehow feels like more of the same. I\u0026rsquo;m chugging along this part (previously with the topic of Type Classes, and now just starting with functions!!!!!) with the golden promise of Haskellland (yes, 3 \u0026lsquo;l\u0026rsquo;s) in horizon 😃. I also started to read some of the Mythical Man-Month, recommended by Wolfram. The first two chapters were a bit tough to read but shared some interesting analogies. One of which compares estimating completion of programming projects to estimating when an omelette will be done. Omelettes require a lot of patience. If the customer wants the omelette in 2 minutes, they have two choices: 1) eat a raw omelette after 2 minutes or 2) wait longer for the omelette to do its thang. The cook similarly has two choices: 1) turn up the heat with the risk of an unsalvageable omelette that is burnt on the outside and runny on the inside or 2) wait for the omelette to do its thang. I thought this was a fun analogy. There is also another part about the conceptual integrity of churches. The execution of building a church dures hundreds of years. Most of the time, the original plans are mostly adhered to and the architect\u0026rsquo;s ideas are able to come to life through the hands of hundreds, maybe thousands of builders. Other churches, however, are made up of different parts, with each part representing a different design. I had heard about this analogy to programs in one of my university courses, and it is something that really stuck with me. It is such a good mindset to at least aim to make the concepts of your programs, applications, or systems portray a consistent (and timeless) set of design practices. I think the \u0026ldquo;quick-fix\u0026rdquo; mentality creates a mish-mosh product that is hard to pass on to any successor.

Our initial solution is to keep popping off and pushing onto the queue of people, but this is not an efficient solution (especially for large n values, this broke Markus\u0026rsquo;s tddbin 😵). We know that there is a mathematical solution that will be more time and space efficient. We saw a couple of them online but were very confused about them\u0026hellip; so we will see if we continue to solve this tomorrow or move onto another problem. Our new summer intern joined our kata this morning because she had mentioned that she was unfamiliar with TDD and wanted to learn about it. No better way to learn something than by doing it (or, at least participate while watching others do it)! Of course this was a very foreign process to me way back when I started participating in the katas (a whopping 2 weeks ago - can you believe how fast time flies!?), so I understood her confusion. It can be quite unintuitive. Otherwise, I worked through more of the Haskell book which is starting to get a bit dry. These past two chapters focus on types (type signatures, type inference, polymorphism, currying, partial application, etc.) which means that the reading is quite dense - at least to me. But the book does a nice job of eliding unecessary details and spreading out exercises nicely to periodically help pump the blood a little bit. I also talked to Ugurcan about the heartbeat he created! This heartbeat dashboard is in many rooms around the offices and displays the previous day\u0026rsquo;s data on the number of visitors, started bookings, and completed bookings on HolidayCheck. He and Wolfram were telling me that many people want to expand this tool, so I will see what input I can get and if it interests me to take this project further.

I also asked Sergii about the problem I shared in the previous post. As a reminder:\n 6 / length [1, 2, 3] \ndoes not work But, for whatever reason (which we now know),\n6 `quot` length [1, 2, 3]\nworks just fine. The length function returns an Int, but it turns out that the \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; operator only works on the \u0026lsquo;Fractional\u0026rsquo; typeclass, of which \u0026lsquo;Int\u0026rsquo; is not an instance. The quot function works on instances of the \u0026lsquo;Integral\u0026rsquo; typeclass. Also, both functions require the arguments to be of the same type 😃 Anyways\u0026hellip; Wolfram shared a video (in the #apprenticeship channel) of an Agile lightning talk. The speaker talks about the basics of TDD and shares the very first step, which is simply \u0026ldquo;Think.\u0026rdquo; This step was relevant in my talk with Peri today. He was talking about how it\u0026rsquo;s usually the case that the ideas we have (regarding our work) when we are lying in bed (e.g. \u0026ldquo;AH! So that\u0026rsquo;s the solution to my problem\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;I just came up with the greatest solution \u0026lsquo;y\u0026rsquo; to some universal problem \u0026lsquo;x.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a genius!\u0026rdquo;) are usually not as great the second or third time we think over them. This has been relevant in many of my previous projects. I tend to jump on my first instinct on how to approach a problem, sometimes to later learn that either a) my instinct was wrong, or b) there was a much better solution. As shared in the video, the first step in TDD is just to think. It can be very powerful to practice TDD every day because it has the potential to make this process habit. I have participated in a few coding katas by now, and we always start off by reading the question and having some time to reflect and ask questions before we dive in. This is a process that is really good for me to practice. So, when it comes to programming (or I suppose work in general), it is always good to go beyond your insticts. Think about the negatives of your approach or the alternatives to your method. On the non-technical aspects of life, however, I do believe that it is good to go with your insticts 😉 On the final note, my one-on-one with \u0026#193;lvaro included some Espa\u0026#241;ol! I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful for this because my Spanish is very rusty. Also, the language part of my brain has been in overdrive the past few weeks.

The first meeting was with Markus to discuss the RSS feed for his blog and try to fix it (to no avail). The second meeting was also with Markus to discuss our plans for the friday talks. We discussed potential schedules, topics, and logistics. We ended up settling on a topic (which will remain a secret for now), so I consider this meeting a success ☺️.\nAfter this, I started creating a blog post for an RSS feed \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo; for those who create a blog with Hugo. Masha suggested doing this because it seems like other apprentices had trouble adding this feature to their Hugo blogs (unless, of course, if the feature was already implemented in their theme).

It was very interesting to hear the insights of people in charge of facilitating remote meetings because I never thought about their perspective. I learned that, as a remote meeting facilitator, it can be very hard to gauge how well the team members are communicating with each other. With remote communication, a lot of the face-to-face interactions are lost (e.g. body language, small talk, immediate response, etc.). The absense of these minor yet important interactions makes it much more difficulat to communicate and create a good team vibe.\nUnfortunately, I did not get a chance to work on any haskell today.

Something that I find really interesting is the fact that \"seniority\" was measured by how incomprehensible one could make their code. If people did not understand some code, they immediately attributed it to the author's skill or wit. Equipped with this mindset, Sandro was very eager to please and impress his manager Namur when he started at a new company on a new team. He was given a task to complete in one week, created a working solution in two days, and proudly approached Namur for feedback. Sandro received a lot of feedback, but none of it was what he was anticipating. He was especially taken aback when Namur called the clever segment of code (created to try to impress Namur by being complicated and difficult to understand) \"disrespectful.\" It is interesting to see how the norms and mentalities have changed. In contrast to the former egocentric and uninclusive mindset, the modern developer has to collaborate and communicate and hold the mentality that they are working towards the same goal as their teammates. This is something that I fully understand and agree with, but I have little experience with it. The solutions to my university projects never had to be explained. Even when I worked on a team, the responsibilities were split and each person only cared for their own tasks. There was never the need or desire to refactor code, as nobody cared to make their solution better or more readable if they already recieved a grade and had moved on to a new project. We worked with the mentality that no one would ever really look at our code (apart from the graders who were usually also students and, quite frankly, trying get their work done as quickly as possible). This is something that should be emphasized in a computer science degree because working on a team is very often a requirement in this (and any other) industry. But, as of now, this is something that I know I will have to work on when I start working on a team. I'm fully prepared for other eyes reviewing my code and giving feedback on how to make it better. The rest of my time was spent with the Haskell Programming book. The first chapter of the Haskell Programming book goes over lambda calculus. I have completed a unit on functional programming, and therefore lambda calculus, while at University, so this was not too foreign to me. Reading the chapter refreshed my memory, and I was able to work through the practice problems with no (or maybe a little) struggle. I just have to remember to evaluate the leftmost and outermost lambdas first (normal order). Tomorrow is more of the same. I will continue reading the Software Crafter book and the Haskell Programming book. I setup my computer for the practice problems in the following chapter. Hopefully with these problems I will be able to integrate some vim and bash learning. Isn't it crazy that every weekday is so perfect and sunny, but every weekend is cloudy and/or rainy?

I was also reminded that I can change my language at any time, so if I find Haskell too hair-pulling or unenjoyable, then I can switch to another. I also plan to start reading Software Craftsmanship and order a public speaking book. Public speaking is something that I have experience with because I taught discussion sections to students when I was an instructional aide at my University.

I also met with my mentor, Peri, today. We went over my self-assessment and starting talking about my areas of focus for the next two months. My first area of concern is tooling. When it comes to git, vim and bash, I only know the things that I needed for my University projects. I never quite understood why I was doing the things I was. Then comes testing. The idea that was engrained in my head by my professors is to write tests before you write code. This is something that was always emphasized, but never enforced. Since I was eager to solve the problems, I RARELY did this. And by rarely I mean once or twice. As a result, I never learned how to write good test cases. There were requirements for our test cases to break the instructors' buggy code, but these were often completed last-minute, and therefore with little consideration. The language I chose to learn is Haskell. I have some experience with functional programming but not enough to be comfortable with it. I think learning Haskell will be a challenge for me as it is for many people accustomed to, well, anything but functional programming. So, to kill three birds with one stone, I will go through a Haskell book that has exercises and incorporate tests and tools when possible.
