[{"categories":null,"contents":"Today was a Haskell day. My current endeavors include foldr and foldl, and believe me: the going got tough. One thing that confused me is the following: Prelude\u0026gt; foldr const 0 ([1..3] ++ undefined)\n\u0026gt;1\nThis works!\n(Note that simply concatenating undefined to a list throws an error, because the list - in its entirety - is evaluated, and the (++) function requires two list arguments.)\n(Also note that const takes two arguments and returns the first argument.)\n(Also also note that foldr works like so: foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs))\nLet\u0026rsquo;s name our list ([1..3] ++ undefined) lst. Here is what happens first: foldr const 0 lst = const (head lst) (foldr const 0 (tail lst)) Since the const function just ignores the second argument, 1 is returned. But, when I wrote this out on paper, I was getting so confused:\n(const 1 (const 2 (const 3 (const undefined 0))))\nWhy doesnt \u0026lsquo;const undefined 0\u0026rsquo; throw an error? Because it is never evaluated as the outer most parentheses are evaluated first, and const just ignores the second argument (bold for emphasis). As for foldl:\nPrelude\u0026gt; foldr const 0 ([1..3] ++ undefined)\n\u0026gt;*** Exception: Prelude.undefined\n\u0026gt;CallStack (from HasCallStack):\n\u0026gt;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:78:14 in base:GHC.Err\n\u0026gt;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;undefined, called at :119:26 in interactive:Ghci20\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t work!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it is written out on paper: ((((1 `const` 0) `const` 2) `const` 3) `cons` undefined) Here, the outermost parentheses contain undefined, and therefore an error is thrown. (I put the `` around const to make it an infix operator for visual purposes. Otherwise, the expansion looks similar to that of foldr). This really confused me. I was thinking: How does foldr know where the end of the list is without having to evaluate the undefined part and foldl doesn\u0026rsquo;t? How does foldr know when to stop looking for more elements in the list and foldl doesn\u0026rsquo;t? But after some help from Lewis, Frank, Francesco, and Daniel (and God (kidding)), it all makes sense. It was funny to see the confusion this question caused, but it thankfully came to a resolution üòÑ Tomorrow I will (start my day at the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde at 7:30*, then) implement some functions (which I already completed with recursion) using folds such as myOr (a function that applies logical or to a list of booleans), myAny (a function that returns whether or not some value in a list meets a certain condition), and squish (which flattens a list of lists into one list). It will be pretty tough to get out of the recursive mindset and implement these functions with folds, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll come out alive üòÖ I will also do some research on the testing pyramid and Docker (whether that be using online or human sources). Signing off! üëã * When I was at the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde the other day, I ended up waiting in the wrong line for 1.5 hours, only to get to the correct place for Blue Card applications and be told that there were no more spots for the day.

I\u0026rsquo;ve completed the Haskell chapters on recursion and lists, and I feel pretty accomplished! I\u0026rsquo;m currently learning about folding lists, which is not as pleasant. Here\u0026rsquo;s an exercise from the book: The following fold has an error. Fix it and then test it in your REPL. foldr const \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; [1..5]\nIf we check the type of const (a function that takes two arguments and returns the first), we get: const :: a -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; a Now, let\u0026rsquo;s check the type of foldr: foldr :: Foldable t =\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; b -\u0026gt; t a -\u0026gt; b Do you see the problem? The type of const does not align with the type required by foldr. The solution is fairly simple: apply flip to const: foldr (flip const) \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; [1..5]\nThe type of (flip const) is: (flip const) :: b -\u0026gt; c -\u0026gt; c This is a solution that took me quite some time to figure out. To no avail, I was filling my notebook with scribbles and parentheses. The solution :t was just waiting for my in my REPL üòÑ Another thing that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work: foldl (:) [] [1..3] (The (:) is the cons function that prepends a head to a list) I really had no idea why this didn\u0026rsquo;t work as I wrote it out. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I wrote: (([] : 1) : 2) : 3 ([1] : 2) : 3 ([2, 1]) : 3 [3, 2, 1] But, no! The REPL throws an error because the type of the (:) function is (:) :: a -\u0026gt; [a] -\u0026gt; [a]. The first argument must be some object of type a, and the second must be a list that contains objects of type a, and the function returns a list that contains objects of type a. The arguments cannot be switched. The topic of folding is very confusing for me, but checking the types of the functions in these exercises help me see the errors and how to fix them. I\u0026rsquo;ll take more time tomorrow to work through the chapter. I also met with Peri today to discuss my progress and the plan for the coming month. One suggestion he made is to rehearse my Haskell learnings through blog posts or lightning talks, hence the small exercise example above. Once I understand foldr and foldl better, I plan to write a more in-depth blog post on the topic. This is just a way to deepen my understanding of the topic. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t treat it like a university course and mechanically work through the book and exercises just to get it done. I should treat it as a topic that I want to learn and, more importantly, teach others about (of course this is not to say that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been enjoying Haskell - because I do! Suprisingly!) Writing blog posts about any of the things I am learning is a way to articulate my thoughts, and I think this is especially helpful for something like functional programming, which confused and angered me in a previous life üçÉ After this, I met with Ugurcan to talk about the Heartbeat project and my goals. The first goal he suggested is to create a simple \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; application and deploy it, just to learn about docker and the dust platform. This was a great suggestion, because it is something that I need to understand before I can move on with this project. I made many new plans today. I have also added 3 trainings/workshops to my TODO list thanks to Peri\u0026rsquo;s and Ugurcan\u0026rsquo;s suggestions. So much to do! So much to see! So much to learn! ü§ì ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/day16/","tags":null,"title":"Blog 16: New plans"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Today was filled with meetings. I had the daily, the \u0026ldquo;Blindspot\u0026rdquo; meeting with Alvaro and his whole group of people of which he\u0026rsquo;s the PPM (not sure what to call this group), a meeting with Ugurcan concerning the setup of the Heartbeat project on my machine, a meeting with Wolfram, and my one-on-one with Alvaro. As a result, my Haskell book has collected (virtual) dust. I spent a lot of my non-meeting time with the Elevator Saga again. I was having a problem where I was creating an event listener for each floor object (for the event where a person presses the up button or down button) in a for-loop. Each of these event listeners would then add the current floor to a set of floors called upButtonFloors and downButtonFloors, respectively. The problem with the following code is that, if there are 5 floors, the value of floorNum that was always being added to the sets is 5. for (floorNum = 0; floorNum \u0026lt; floors.length; floorNum++) {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;floors[floorNum].on(\u0026ldquo;up_button_pressed\u0026rdquo;, function() {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;upButtonFloors.add(floorNum);\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;}); \n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;floors[floorNum].on(\u0026ldquo;down_button_pressed\u0026rdquo;, function() {\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;downButtonFloors.add(floorNum); \n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp;});\n}\nThis question turned my meeting with Wolfram into a JavaScript Closure meeting (instead of a meeting about ways to have the Heartbeat monitors rotate between different URLs). Wolfram taught me about the call stack and what happens with asynchronous instructions. We worked through a more general example in TDD bin that asynchronously added values to an array. We went over what works (and why) and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t (and why). It was a lot to digest, but going through this example made everything a lot clearer. In the end, we learned that simply adding a \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rdquo; will reduce the scope of floorNum to just the body of the for loop, so when an event happens, the handler calls a function with the intended value. Though I know this is not a complete answer to \u0026ldquo;why this works.\u0026rdquo; If I were a more seasoned JavaScript programmer, I would have added the let in the first place and therefore would not have run into this problem. But I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did because it led me to ask Wolfram, which led to an in depth explanation of what is happening under the hood and how to fix it. If I had added the let, I would have no real understanding of the call stack, what happens when we call setTimeout(), and how asynchronous instructions are handled in JavaScript (which is single threaded, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure most of you know). Regarding the Heartbeat monitors, there are quite a few chrome extensions that rotate between different URLs (one has the name \u0026ldquo;Rotisserie,\u0026rdquo; which kind of displeases me because it makes me think of chicken) which, as of now, seems like the route I will take. The cool thing about this is that anyone who wants to add a feature may create their own application and add the link to the list of URLs on rotate. Alvaro was saying how this would be good for future apprentices/interns to contribute to as well. It would be an interesting why to learn how to create a web application while also adding value to the company! So, my day flew by and it has come to an end.

Today, Wolfram joined the kata, but neither Masha nor Kay could join and Markus had to leave early. Our current kata does not involve TDD (üò±). The problem is called \u0026ldquo;Elevator Saga.\u0026rdquo; Each level provides a task to move x amount of people in some amount of time, using only a certain number of elevators. The simulator is the main source of testing, which provides random input to test your solution. In the katas that I joined, we only made it to level 5. Our next step was to refactor to make it more readable and pass the simulation more often (üòÖ). Wolfram was grilling me with all these questions: \u0026ldquo;What is your goal?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How do you know when you have improved?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What is your approach?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What do you want to learn from this problem?\u0026rdquo;. I never thought about neither these questions nor their answers. My approach was just to pass each level. So after explaining the half-baked solution to him, Wolfram suggested many ways to make the code more readable. He also taught me that creating an event listener inside of an event listener results in only creating the inner event listener when the outer even is triggered (and, it will do this every time). This is bad. My solution to this aspect was to create an event listener once for each floor object. There are many other ways in which the code needs to be improved. Right now when it is passing a floor on which people are waiting, the elevator does not pick them up. More on this tomorrow. I also worked on Haskell today which was focused on recursion. I was getting some pretty headache-y errors in the REPL when trying to create a function that took an integer n and return a list that contains each digit, in order, of n. Here is the error:  Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num [a]\n(Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)\n\u0026emsp; When checking the inferred type\n\u0026emsp; \u0026emsp; go :: forall a.

Instead of ([num `rem` 10] + list), I need ((num `rem` 10) : list). This was kind of hard to figure out because the error message is hard to interpret.

I think point 3 is what really tripped me up. The wording of \u0026ldquo;returning a function\u0026rdquo; is weird to me, but the book does a nice job of explaining what exaclty happens. And for that, I am very grateful üòÑ. I also spoke with Wolfram and Markus (Scheuermann, not Heilig) about potential additions to Ugurcan\u0026rsquo;s Heartbeat project. We discussed making the information more personal, with hopes to spark conversation. Markus said something like \u0026ldquo;information that encourages action.\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s a good mindset to have going forward with this project. Wolfram and I briefly discussed our first step: Come up with a way to have multiple urls on rotation, where one can easily add/remove urls displaying different information. Exciting! Today I did more Haskell and read some of the Software Crafter book. I also spent some time refreshing my memory on the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges (this urge was sparked when I saw the Haskell book quote him at the beginning of the recursion chapter), and I stumbled accross some information that he was incredibly racist and said awful things about black people. That was a disappointing tangent to which, oddly enough, the Haskell book led me. But back to the main path of focus: Recursion, hooray! Here\u0026rsquo;s one of the first examples they give, where a number n is incremented times times: incTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) =\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; a\nincTimes 0 n = n\nincTimes times n = 1 + (incTimes (times - 1) n) Then the function is called like so:\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 10 0\n10\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 5 0\n5\nPrelude\u0026gt; incTimes 5 5\n10 The only unintuitive thing, for me, is seeing incTimes 0 n = n. It\u0026rsquo;s strange to see how this is how base cases (and, similarly, conditionals) are defined. It\u0026rsquo;s just weird not to see an if in there.

I went over pattern matching, case examples, and higher order functions. Though the book does a good job explaining the why\u0026rsquo;s and how\u0026rsquo;s, functional programming still feels quite unintuitive to me. One thing that is hard for me to conceptualize (and I tend to overthink) is function types. An example given in the book is: returnAfterApply :: (a -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; a -\u0026gt; c -\u0026gt; b returnAfterApply f a c = f a At first, only looking at the function type, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking: Ok, returnAfterApply takes a function and returns a function that takes a function and returns something of type b??? üòÖ But then I look at the function definitions and I think: Ohhhh, so it takes three parameters: 1. a function f that takes some thing of type a and returns something of type b, 2. something of type a, and 3. something of type c.

We passed the level where the building was 3 stories high, but could not figure out an algorithm quick enough for a building with 4 stories. To be continued\u0026hellip; hopefully. The rest of my day was spent with Haskell, which somehow feels like more of the same. I\u0026rsquo;m chugging along this part (previously with the topic of Type Classes, and now just starting with functions!!!!!) with the golden promise of Haskellland (yes, 3 \u0026lsquo;l\u0026rsquo;s) in horizon üòÉ. I also started to read some of the Mythical Man-Month, recommended by Wolfram. The first two chapters were a bit tough to read but shared some interesting analogies. One of which compares estimating completion of programming projects to estimating when an omelette will be done. Omelettes require a lot of patience. If the customer wants the omelette in 2 minutes, they have two choices: 1) eat a raw omelette after 2 minutes or 2) wait longer for the omelette to do its thang. The cook similarly has two choices: 1) turn up the heat with the risk of an unsalvageable omelette that is burnt on the outside and runny on the inside or 2) wait for the omelette to do its thang. I thought this was a fun analogy. There is also another part about the conceptual integrity of churches. The execution of building a church dures hundreds of years. Most of the time, the original plans are mostly adhered to and the architect\u0026rsquo;s ideas are able to come to life through the hands of hundreds, maybe thousands of builders. Other churches, however, are made up of different parts, with each part representing a different design. I had heard about this analogy to programs in one of my university courses, and it is something that really stuck with me. It is such a good mindset to at least aim to make the concepts of your programs, applications, or systems portray a consistent (and timeless) set of design practices.

I have participated in a few coding katas by now, and we always start off by reading the question and having some time to reflect and ask questions before we dive in.

We discussed potential schedules, topics, and logistics. We ended up settling on a topic (which will remain a secret for now), so I consider this meeting a success ‚ò∫Ô∏è.\nAfter this, I started creating a blog post for an RSS feed \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo; for those who create a blog with Hugo. Masha suggested doing this because it seems like other apprentices had trouble adding this feature to their Hugo blogs (unless, of course, if the feature was already implemented in their theme). Unfortunately, adding html text to a markdown file caused me a lot of trouble, so I was not able to finish it before my first workshop.\nMy first workshop, hosted by Jens, was about remote collaboration. It was very interesting to hear the insights of people in charge of facilitating remote meetings because I never thought about their perspective. I learned that, as a remote meeting facilitator, it can be very hard to gauge how well the team members are communicating with each other. With remote communication, a lot of the face-to-face interactions are lost (e.g. body language, small talk, immediate response, etc.). The absense of these minor yet important interactions makes it much more difficulat to communicate and create a good team vibe.\nUnfortunately, I did not get a chance to work on any haskell today. So tomorrow, I will complete my RSS how-to post and work on Haskell.\nBut man, my brain is fried. The workshop was 3.5 hours long and in a room that had no AC. It was a great workshop and I learned a lot, but I went through 3 full bottles of water as a result of the heat (hense the title of this post). Time to go walk home in the heat\u0026hellip; to an apartment similarly with no AC. Please keep me in your prayers (I\u0026rsquo;m just being dramatic for fun. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll survive. But I\u0026rsquo;d still appreciate some prayersüòÖ).

Edit the config.toml file: a. Make sure the baseURL is valid (e.g. \"https://leahchung.netlify.com\")\nb. Add the following lines:\n [outputs] home = [ \"RSS\", \"HTML\"]\n[outputFormats] [outputFormats.RSS] mediatype = \"application/rss\" baseName = \"rss\"  2. Edit the header.html file. a. Add the following line:  \u0026lt;link href=\"{{ .RSSLink }}\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" title=\"{{ .Site.Title }}\" /\u0026gt;\n I added this in my 'header-widget' div, but this will depend on your theme. 3. Add an rss.xml file in the your_theme/layouts/ directory. Then add the code found here. 4. Add the following to the top of each post markdown file:  layout: rss  Voila! This should do the trick, but I suppose everyone's unique theme will create unique issues. I hope you found this post useful! ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/rss_howto/","tags":null,"title":"How to: Implement an RSS feed with Hugo"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Today I started reading The Software [Crafter] by Sandro Mancuso. Something that I find really interesting is the fact that \"seniority\" was measured by how incomprehensible one could make their code. If people did not understand some code, they immediately attributed it to the author's skill or wit. Equipped with this mindset, Sandro was very eager to please and impress his manager Namur when he started at a new company on a new team. He was given a task to complete in one week, created a working solution in two days, and proudly approached Namur for feedback. Sandro received a lot of feedback, but none of it was what he was anticipating. He was especially taken aback when Namur called the clever segment of code (created to try to impress Namur by being complicated and difficult to understand) \"disrespectful.\" It is interesting to see how the norms and mentalities have changed. In contrast to the former egocentric and uninclusive mindset, the modern developer has to collaborate and communicate and hold the mentality that they are working towards the same goal as their teammates. This is something that I fully understand and agree with, but I have little experience with it. The solutions to my university projects never had to be explained. Even when I worked on a team, the responsibilities were split and each person only cared for their own tasks. There was never the need or desire to refactor code, as nobody cared to make their solution better or more readable if they already recieved a grade and had moved on to a new project. We worked with the mentality that no one would ever really look at our code (apart from the graders who were usually also students and, quite frankly, trying get their work done as quickly as possible). This is something that should be emphasized in a computer science degree because working on a team is very often a requirement in this (and any other) industry. But, as of now, this is something that I know I will have to work on when I start working on a team. I'm fully prepared for other eyes reviewing my code and giving feedback on how to make it better. The rest of my time was spent with the Haskell Programming book. The first chapter of the Haskell Programming book goes over lambda calculus. I have completed a unit on functional programming, and therefore lambda calculus, while at University, so this was not too foreign to me. Reading the chapter refreshed my memory, and I was able to work through the practice problems with no (or maybe a little) struggle. I just have to remember to evaluate the leftmost and outermost lambdas first (normal order). Tomorrow is more of the same. I will continue reading the Software Crafter book and the Haskell Programming book. I setup my computer for the practice problems in the following chapter. Hopefully with these problems I will be able to integrate some vim and bash learning. Isn't it crazy that every weekday is so perfect and sunny, but every weekend is cloudy and/or rainy? When will this madness stop???? For some totally shocking information, please take a look at your Munich weather forecast for this weekend :) ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/day5/","tags":null,"title":"Day 5: Software Crafter and Haskell Programming"},{"categories":null,"contents":" The title of this blog post does not refer to my feelings about this week being over. It refers to my feelings about successfully setting up the RSS for my blog (Thank you to my PPM Alvaro for suggesting better blog post titles. Your suggestion was well-received). Today:\nAfter trying many methods to make my RSS feed link valid, I finally (FINALLY!) came to the solution which was in my config.toml file. The base URL was \"http:leahchung.netlify.com\" rather than \"https://leahchung.netlify.com\". Silly me. This one small change proved hours' worth of work to be useless, but that makes it all the more satisfying to see the green \"congratulations!\" on the page of the RSS-feed-link-validator website. Here is the link so if you want to share my joy: https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A//leahchung.netlify.com/rss.xml Next week:\nNext week, I plan to start my journey with Haskell. I got some recommendations to use Haskell Book which includes a lot of exercises. This sounds like it would be good for me because I learn best by doing (and doing again). I was also reminded that I can change my language at any time, so if I find Haskell too hair-pulling or unenjoyable, then I can switch to another. I also plan to start reading Software Craftsmanship and order a public speaking book. Public speaking is something that I have experience with because I taught discussion sections to students when I was an instructional aide at my University. Despite my practice, I am nowhere near perfect. It still frightens me, so hopefully a book will help calm some of these nerves. I also have to get better at the dailies. Wolfram suggested doing some research and deciding how to use the 15 minutes to gain/give as much as I can. My first week:\nI can't believe my first week at HolidayCheck is coming to an end! This week was filled with a lot of firsts for me. I joined my first (and second) coding kata, participated in my first mob programming session, made a lot of first impressions, and started my first real job (!). I plan to have many more firsts during my apprenticeship at HolidayCheck, and I'm really excited! In addition to all of this, I set up my blog, came up with an agenda for the next two months with Peri, and worked out ALMOST all of the administrative stuff (I just need that darn tax ID...). Overall, I had a really good first week at HolidayCheck. I'm excited for what is to come, but for now... Prost to the freakin' weekend! (A Rihanna lyric with a German twist) ","permalink":"https://leahchung.netlify.com/posts/day4md/","tags":null,"title":"Day 4: FINALLY!!"},{"categories":null,"contents":" My main focus today was to work on my blog. I deployed it to netlify yesterday (thank you to the former/current apprentice(s) for the recommendation), but it was a very simply blog theme. Today I worked on making it prettier :). I also met with my mentor, Peri, today. We went over my self-assessment and starting talking about my areas of focus for the next two months. My first area of concern is tooling. When it comes to git, vim and bash, I only know the things that I needed for my University projects. I never quite understood why I was doing the things I was. Then comes testing. The idea that was engrained in my head by my professors is to write tests before you write code. This is something that was always emphasized, but never enforced. Since I was eager to solve the problems, I RARELY did this. And by rarely I mean once or twice. As a result, I never learned how to write good test cases. There were requirements for our test cases to break the instructors' buggy code, but these were often completed last-minute, and therefore with little consideration. The language I chose to learn is Haskell. I have some experience with functional programming but not enough to be comfortable with it. I think learning Haskell will be a challenge for me as it is for many people accustomed to, well, anything but functional programming. So, to kill three birds with one stone, I will go through a Haskell book that has exercises and incorporate tests and tools when possible. When this all gets overwhelming or boring, I intend to read The Software Crafter and a book on public speaking (More on this later). Now, time for a day off. How convenient that I started work on a week with a public holiday :) - though this was completely a coincidence, I swear. Since I spent a little more time on prettifying my blog, I will work on adding it to the HolidayCheck Apprentice page on Friday. Ciao!

Upon arrival at HolidayCheck, I was greeted by current and former software engineer apprentices. After short introductions, I was shown to my desk. My equipment was all set, and I even recieved some gifts from the company! I was then introduced to everyone that Peri and I could find. There are many people and many names... but the \"National Specialties BBQ\" helped me familiarize myself with some of the employees. I got the chance to spend a lot of time with my PPM, Alvaro, throughout the day. He answered all the questions I had (and I'm sure many more to come), talked about his experience at HolidayCheck, and made me feel really comfortable with the whole onboarding process. The rest of my time is spent going through a checklist of tasks from Wolfram, which consists of various things from exploring Logbook to organising a social event. I think I am making pretty good progress. Some of my tasks for the week are create a blog, write a blog post every day, and start a self-organization method. The self-organization method will take some research and consideration (right now I am just using the Notes app to keep track of things I want to accomplish today)... so more on that later. My plans for the rest of the day are to add my blog to HolidayCheck's apprenticeship page, complete the self assessment, and ENJOY THE WEATHER! Everyone has been super friendly and open, which has made the transition of starting a new job in a new country extremely pleasant. I'm excited for what is to come!
