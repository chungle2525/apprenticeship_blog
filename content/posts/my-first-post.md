My first day at HolidayCheck went really well, my first impression of the company was really great!

Upon arrival at HolidayCheck, I was greeted by current and former software engineer apprentices. After short introductions, I was shown to my desk. My equipment was all set, and I even recieved some gifts from the company! I was then introduced to everyone that Peri and I could find. There are many people and many names... but the "National Specialties BBQ" helped me familiarize myself with some of the employees.
