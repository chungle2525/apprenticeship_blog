My first couple of days at HolidayCheck went really well, my first impression of the company was really great!
<br><br>
Upon arrival at HolidayCheck, I was greeted by current and former software engineer apprentices. After short introductions, I was shown to my desk. My equipment was all set, and I even recieved some gifts from the company! I was then introduced to everyone that Peri and I could find. There are many people and many names... but the "National Specialties BBQ" helped me familiarize myself with some of the employees.
<br><br>
I got the chance to spend a lot of time with my PPM, Alvaro, throughout the day. He answered all the questions I had (and I'm sure many more to come), talked about his experience at HolidayCheck, and made me feel really comfortable with the whole onboarding process.
<br><br>
The rest of my time is spent going through a checklist of tasks from Wolfram, which consists of various things from exploring Logbook to organising a social event. I think I am making pretty good progress.
Some of my tasks for the week are create a blog, write a blog post every day, and start a self-organization method. The self-organization method will take some research and consideration (right now I am just using the Notes app to keep track of things I want to accomplish today)... so more on that later.
<br><br>
My plans for the rest of the day are to add my blog to HolidayCheck's apprenticeship page, complete the self assessment, and ENJOY THE WEATHER!
<br><br>
Everyone has been super friendly and open, which has made the transition of starting a new job in a new country extremely pleasant. I'm excited for what is to come!

Bis Morgen:)
